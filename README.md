# Computer-Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

## Image Recognition
Image recognition refers to the task of inputting an image into a neural network and having it output some kind of label for that image. The label that the network outputs will correspond to a pre-defined class. There can be multiple classes that the image can be labeled as, or just one. If there is a single class, the term "recognition" is often applied, whereas a multi-class recognition task is often called "classification".

A subset of image classification is object detection, where specific instances of objects are identified as belonging to a certain class like animals, cars, or people.

## Image Processing
Image processing is a way to convert an image to a digital aspect and perform certain functions on it, in order to get an enhanced image or extract other useful information from it. It is a type of signal time when the input is an image, such as a video frame or image and output can be an image or features associated with that image. Usually, the Image Processing system includes treating images as two equal symbols while using the set methods used.

It is one of the fastest growing technologies today, with its use in various business sectors. Graphic Design forms the core of the research space within the engineering and computer science industry as well. 

Image processing basically involves the following three steps.
Importing an image with an optical scanner or digital photography.
Analysis and image management including data compression and image enhancement and visual detection patterns such as satellite imagery.
It produces the final stage where the result can be changed to an image or report based on image analysis.
Image processing is a way by which an individual can enhance the quality of an image or gather alerting insights from an image and feed it to an algorithm to predict the later things.
