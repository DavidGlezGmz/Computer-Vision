# Computer-Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

## Image Recognition
Image recognition refers to the task of inputting an image into a neural network and having it output some kind of label for that image. The label that the network outputs will correspond to a pre-defined class. There can be multiple classes that the image can be labeled as, or just one. If there is a single class, the term "recognition" is often applied, whereas a multi-class recognition task is often called "classification".

A subset of image classification is object detection, where specific instances of objects are identified as belonging to a certain class like animals, cars, or people.
