# Computer-Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.

This model focuses on classifying tweets into 12 random categories..It has 3,218 tweets from different users. Code to scrap the data is available in this repository.

The data set is called "data_elonmusk2.csv".

### KMeans Clustering.
Distance computation in k-Means weighs each dimension equally and hence care must be taken to ensure that unit of dimension shouldn’t distort relative near-ness of observations. Common method is to unit-standar
